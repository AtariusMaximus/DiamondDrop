Diamond Drop is a small 4k game written in 2015 that is loosely based on the iOS game 'Duet', which I really enjoyed. You have two Diamonds at the bottom of the screen that will rotate in a circle in either direction along a diamond shaped path. Barriers will fall from the top of the screen in a random pattern and you must avoid them by circling around them (or through them if there is a large enough opening). Every barrier you pass will score you a point. The game will slowly get faster up to it's maximum speed after you've passed 20 barriers.
Gameplay Notes:

You can press down on the joystick to move the barriers down the screen faster (just like Tetris). It's useful if you've got yourself positioned correctly and just want to quickly bypass the barrier.
You start each new game with 6 bombs which are indicated as dots on the status bar.  Press the fire button to use a bomb, which will erase the current barrier on the screen.  It's useful if it looks like you're not going to be able to easily pass it.
Your high score will be saved on the title screen, however it does not save once you turn the game off.
You can select your speed on the title screen.  Push up or down on the joystick and you'll see either "Lo" or "Hi" selected.  Press the fire button to start the game.  Your speed selection will persist in-between games.
You can select the size of the rotating diamonds with the left difficulty switch.  Slide it to 'A' for larger diamonds, 'B' for smaller diamonds.
